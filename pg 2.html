<h1>My favorite console games</h1>
<ul>I play on console</ul>
<ul>My top 3 playstaion games to play would have to be</ul>
<li>Rainbow Six Siege(R6)</li>
<li>Dead By Daylight(DBD)</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<ul>I have been playing R6 for years now. It is a strategic first person shooter. I play zofia the most. She can destroy walls and blind/concussion enemies.</ul>
<ul>I have started to play DBD last year and have gotten back into the game. It is a fun and stregtegic game where you have to do generators to open the gates and escape from the killer. A new killer and survivor came out, ALien and Ellen Ripley. I am very excited to play in this new chapter.</ul>
<ul>Minecraft is fun to play when I have nothing else to do, and it always makes me sleepy for some reason.</ul>
<strong>Honorable mention</strong>
<li>SPIDERMAN PS4/SPIDERMAN MILES MORALES</li>
<ul>I love the Spidermna games and make me very relaxed and happy swinging around New York City</ul>
