<strong>ingredients</strong>
<li>Start with a 2.5 cm thick ribeye or sirloin steak</li>

<li>Sirloin has smaller veins of fat</li>
<strong>Important to note-</strong>
<li>Look out for gristle on the steak. It is the rubbery cartillage of the steak</li>
<li>Next it is time to cook the steak </li>
<li>High smoke oil like sunflower oil is needed</li>
<li>Plenty of salt and grounded black pepper</li>
<li>Some garlc, fresh thyme or rosemary springs, and of course a little butter</li>
<li>Coat steak on both sides with oil then make sure to add plenty of salt and pepper</li>
<li>Heat up your pan and add your steak to it</li>
<li>Cook for 4 minutes until you turn it</li>
<li>During the last minute add butter to pan, also a few lightly peeled garlic cloves, and some thyme </li>
<li>Take steak out of the pan after cooking and leave to rest for 4-5 minutes</li>

<strong>Now you have a nice cooked stek for you and your family</strong>
